# Jenny's Node Boilerplate
## With Pug, Express and jQuery

### What's all this?

A blank slate with express, pug and node set up and ready to go. The server file is configured to work easily with Heroku if you want to deploy something to web. Please be warned that there may be some traces of my sense of humour left in here somewhere.

There's already a public folder with a stylesheet and jQuery, plus a (mostly) blank index page.

### How to use:

```
npm install
```

```
node server.js
```
